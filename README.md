## 🏆 Featured Projects  
### 🔹 **Project 1: Name Classification using RNN - Pytorch from scratch**  
Description:
This project implements a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) from scratch using PyTorch to classify names into their respective categories (e.g., languages or regions). It demonstrates how sequence data can be processed for classification tasks.

Highlights:

Built the RNN architecture from the ground up without relying on high-level APIs.
Used one-hot encoding for name representation.
Implemented gradient-based optimization and evaluated model accuracy.
Visualized training progress and analyzed model predictions.
Tech Stack:

Programming Language: Python
Framework: PyTorch
Tools: Matplotlib (for visualization), NumPy
